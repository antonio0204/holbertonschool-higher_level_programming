# Python - More Classes and Objects
----
Object-oriented programming is one of the most effective approaches to writing code. In in this approach we set classes and then we create objects based on these classes. When you write a class, you define a general description and the functionality of a whole category of what objects can have. When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with this description and functionality. Making an object from a class is called instantiation, and you work with instances of a class.
