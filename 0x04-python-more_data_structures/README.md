A dictionary is a general-purpose data structure for storing a group of objects. A dictionary has a set of keys and each key has a single associated value. When presented with a key, the dictionary will return the associated value.

For example, the results of a classroom test could be represented as a dictionary with pupil's names as keys and their scores as the values:

```sh
results = {'Cristian' : 29,
           'Ricardo' : 84,
           'Joss' : 22,
           'Ronald' : 75,
          }
```
Instead of using the numerical index of the data, we can use the dictionary names to return values:

```sh
>>> results['Ricardo']
84
>>> results['Cristian']
29
```
