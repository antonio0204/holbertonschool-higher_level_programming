# Test-driven development
---
With test-driven development (TDD), developers create and automate tests that validate the functionality of the software they are coding. They write only the code that gets validated in order to keep it clear and simple, eliminate bugs, and speed up the development process.

TDD has been around for over two decades now. It was initially associated with extreme programming, which aims to maximize software quality and responsiveness. In recent years, however, it has grown in popularity as a standalone approach to improving the productivity of development teams and generating better code.
